# Data Science & Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my data science portfolio â€” a curated collection of projects showcasing my experience with data analysis, visualization, programming, and machine learning. This repository includes work across various tools and languages such as Python, R, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau. Some of these projects are based on real-world projects I have created for work.
